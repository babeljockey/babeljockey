<article style=""><h1>Open access and the humanities</h1><p>At the end of 2013 and 2014 I wrote blog posts on Occam's Corner &amp;lpar;over at the Guardian&amp;rpar; to list and briefly review the books I read in each of those years&amp;period; I want to develop this practice into a good habit because it spurs me to read&amp;semi; and I hope it might also serve to flag up titles of interest to others&amp;period;</p><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8659/16307751395_38b275f69b_o.jpg" /></article>
